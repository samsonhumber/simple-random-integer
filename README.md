# simple-random-integer

A quick proof-of-concept for making npm packages, simplifies the math.random function for finding random integers

# PLAN

- Make an NPM package that makes randomization easier
- Create node modules and index.js
- Write the code for random integer
  - Aim: random(1, 100) => returns random number from 1 to 100
  - If one argument, assume 0 is lower bound
  - Throws error when no args input
 - Write the code for a random float, rounded to a set number of decimal places/significant figures.

# IDEAS

- Array shuffler
- Random order of letters in string or words in sentence
- Gaussian distribution
  - needs mean and standard deviation as arguments
- 2-D array, shuffling elements of that?
- Switches keys and values of object around randomly
- Generating randomness, like a random array of numbers, of random length
- Something that prints something random in the console in response to a command?

# GOALS

- Create an NPM package that allows integer randomization (expand from there)
- Demonstrate the installed NPM package
- Have documentation that explains how to use package
